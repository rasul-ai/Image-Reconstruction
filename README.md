This repository is created based on my experiment on Image reconstruction. From 1 year I am learning different tools and technology on deep learning. I am providing an overview of how I am doing my experiment to improve outcomes of autoencoder model.
For the experiment I have used 3 kinds of dataset. The dataset are available on opensource. The dataset that I have used is uploaded partially on this repository.
'''
I have used,
1. MNIST dataset
2. Cats and Dogs dataset.
3. Pneumonia Chest Xray Image dataset.

'''
I have also uploaded the ipynb file of the model so that anyone can access it and show my experiment result. And also anyone can download this repository and used these resources.
I have done these experiment on Colab due to limitation of Local Pc with GPU.
